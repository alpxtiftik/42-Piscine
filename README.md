# 42 Piscine - 2025

This repository contains the C language and Shell projects, exercises, and library work completed during the **42 Istanbul** Piscine training process.

The Piscine is a 26-day intensive boot camp rooted in the peer-to-peer learning methodology, designed to lay the foundations of software development. The code in this repository reflects a learning curve ranging from the basics of C to memory management and pointer arithmetic.

## Content Structure

Each folder contains the tasks and learning outcomes for the respective module:

```

## Usage and Compilation
These projects were developed in accordance with Norminette rules (42 School's strict coding standards). The cc compiler and standard flags are generally used to compile the code:


```bash
cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror filename.c -o program
./program
```
